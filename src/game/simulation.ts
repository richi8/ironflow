   * Advance the world by exactly one fixed timestep.

   * Phase order (ironflow.md §8). Every tick runs these in this order:
   *
   *   1. commands      drain queue, validate, apply                    [C04]
   *   2. power         network supply/demand -> satisfaction ratio     [C21]
   *   3. mining        miners extract into their buffers               [C11]
   *   4. production    machines advance progress, consume, produce     [C15]
   *   5. belts         move items, hand off between belts (downstream-first)  [C13]
   *   6. inserters     transfer between belts / machines / chests      [C14]
   *   7. research      consume science, advance, apply unlocks         [C22]
   *   8. player        movement, manual mining progress                [C10]
   *   9. cleanup       process removals, compact stores, emit events   [C05]
   *
   * Power resolves first so every machine in the tick sees one satisfaction
   * ratio. Mining precedes production so freshly-mined ore is consumable the
   * same tick. Belts precede inserters so an inserter reads a settled belt
   * position, which keeps throughput predictable instead of oscillating with
   * array order. Cleanup runs last so no system observes a half-removed entity.
